# Hi Guys,
#
# First and foremost with this I wanted to extend my sincerest thanks and
# gratitude for the opportunity to interview with your team. I have to admit,
# I was caught a little by surprise and was not prepared to demonstrate
# some of my past projects involving the specific type of developmental work
# that was requested. I have somewhat of a personal collection of trial and
# error libraries that have been placed here and there throughout the web.
# Some on Dropbox, Box.com, others on Github, many of which are incomplete
# as they are my sandbox items and the majority versioned out into private    # storage. I put some post-motivational thought into our meeting and came to
# a conclusion that I may have not accurately displayed or articulated some of # the fundamental talent that you are looking for in the position in which I
# applied. So I thought it would be in the best interest of everybody involved
# if I left you guys with a tangible sample that could be used to disseminate # and/or analyze my capabilities utilizing the aforementioned tools.
#
# Enjoy!
